Use a provided AWS instance. For Lab 1 you can also use your local workstation.

## Intro to Lab format

This section will introduce the format for the labs used. The labs are provided as a set of milestones.

1. First, we will introduce a challenge or task for you to complete, e.g. "Task 1: Service".

1. There will be concepts and references for you to review.

1. We will timebox self-paced content during a live workshop.

1. We use [`git`][git] [branches][git-branches] to provide important milestones after a task is complete or as a starting point for a task. If you did not complete a specific task, you can use these milestones to proceed to the next task or review the solution.

1. We will wrap up the task with a group discussion / Q&A on:
    1. Why are customers doing this?
    1. What are the benefits of doing this?
    1. What are the implications?
